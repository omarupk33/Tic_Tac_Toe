This is by far the hardest challange I have encountered. It took way longer than I essentially thought it would. I exprimented and commited a lot 
with this. Practicing factory functions and doing my best to not make any global values was the goal. I did my absolute best to not google anything
since things seemed obvious most of the time, yet I could have saved a lot of time if I googled. Proud to call it a learning experience and it's done!
